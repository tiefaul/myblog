As I expanded my Proxmox environment, I wanted a better way to monitor the health of my server in real-time. The provided monitoring for my server given by proxmox itself was very limited and felt lacking. However, it was a nice feature given that the purpose of Proxmox as a whole isn’t just for monitoring. After researching various options, I decided to set up a monitoring solution using <strong>InfluxDB</strong> and <strong>Grafana</strong>. InfluxDB is a high performance time-series database, perfect for storing metrics, while Grafana provides rich, customizable visualizations.</p> <p>In this post, I will discuss with you how I integrated these tools to monitor my Proxmox server. From setting up InfluxDB to visualizing metrics in Grafana.</p> <hr/> <h1 id="creating-the-docker-compose">Creating the docker compose</h1> <p>After reading various documents, reddit post, videos, etc. I came to a conclusion that I would create docker containers for both Grafana and InfluxDB. Given that both have verified publishers for their containers on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> I felt comfortable moving forward with my decision.</p> <p>Step 1:<br/> Create a directory to store the compose file.<br/></p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">mkdir </span>monitoring
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command to verify the directory was made.</p> <p>Step 2:<br/> Create the compose file.</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">touch </span>compose.yaml

</code></pre></div></div> <blockquote> <p>Please note that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./conf</code> volume on the Grafana service was necessary for me because I needed to change the default port of 3000 to 3089 inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">default.ini</code> file of the container. So if you do not need to change the port, use the recommended port option of 3000 for the Grafana service and remove the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./conf</code> volume.</p> </blockquote> <hr/> <h1 id="create-your-volume-and-network">Create your volume and network</h1> <p>In our compose file we set the network and volumes to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">external: true</code> meaning we have to create these resources ourselves or else the compose file will error out because it cannot find the volume or network.</p> <p>Run these commands to create our volumes and network:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>docker volume create grafana-volume

Unless you changed your ports like I did, then you should be good to go. I added all my services to my <strong>Homepage</strong> dashboard for easier navigation between all my services. I will make a post going over what Homepage is in a later post, but for now if you are interested, here is a GitHub link to <a href="https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage">HomePage</a>. Once inside your containers. Make sure you create a account in InfluxDB and the default username and password for Grafana is admin:admin. Once you are in your instances I highly recommend watching Christian Lempa’s video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2eyVfCTLi0&amp;t=403s">My new Proxmox Monitoring Tools: InfluxDB2 + Grafana</a> on what to do next. He goes over what I went through and MORE!</p> <hr/> <h1 id="what-should-i-do-now">What should I do now?</h1> <p>Just like you I was confused on how everything worked and what to do next. When watching Christian Lempa’s video, I imported the <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/15356-proxmox-cluster-flux/">Proxmox Cluster [Flux]</a> dashboard from the <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana website</a>, but I felt as if I wasn’t learning anything from doing that, even though the dashboard is great and amazing and provides me with everything I want from a monitoring standpoint. My next objective in this learning journey is to create my own dashboard, learn a little bit of flux, and see how everything pans out.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="monitoring"/><category term="database"/><category term="flux"/><category term="grafana"/><category term="influxdb"/><category term="walkthrough"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using flux and grafana to monitor my Proxmox server]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hosting my first website</title><link href="https://www.levitatecold.com/blog/2024/Jekyll-Website/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hosting my first website"/><published>2024-08-11T16:10:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-11T16:10:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.levitatecold.com/blog/2024/Jekyll-Website</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.levitatecold.com/blog/2024/Jekyll-Website/"><![CDATA[<p>When I first decided to create my own personal website, I was faced with a common dilemma: which platform should I use? The obvious choice seemed to be website builders like Wix, Squarespace, and Weebly given there simplicity and popularity. However, as I explored my options, I found myself drawn to something more customizable and developer-friendly…. <strong>Jekyll</strong>.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="why-jekyll">Why Jekyll?</h2> <p>One of the main reasons to I chose Jekyll is the unparalleled flexibility it offers. Unlike Wordpress, which can sometimes feel restrictive with its themes and plugins, Jekyll gives me complete control over every aspect of my website. From the layout and design to the functionality and content structure, I can tailor anything to match my vision if I wanted to do so. This level of customization was exactly what I was looking for as someone who enjoys tinkering and learning new things with code and experimenting with different ideas.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="integration-with-github-pages">Integration with GitHub Pages</h2> <p>Another significant advantage of Jekyll is its seamless integration with <strong>Github Pages</strong>. As someone who loves exploring projects on GitHub, I was excited to use a platform that works so well with Git’s version control system. With Jekyll, I can host my website directly from a GitHub repository, making it easy to manage updates, track changes, and collaborate with others if needed. Plus, deploying the site is as simple as pushing commits to my repository—no need to worry about complex setups or hosting fees.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="the-appeal-of-using-wsl-and-git">The Appeal of Using WSL and Git</h2> <p>I wanted to learn more about using <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> (WSL) and <strong>Git</strong>. With Jekyll, I could easily set up my development environment on WSL, clone my repository using Git, and manage my site entirely from the command line. So not am I only getting more hands on with using Git commands, I am learning how to traverse through a linux environment right on my windows system, thanks to WSL! This hands-on approach allowed me to deepen my understanding of version control and site deployment, skills that I wanted to develop as a someone who is eager to learn new things in IT.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="performance-and-security">Performance and Security</h2> <p>Jekyll’s static site generation also stood out to me for its performance and security benefits. Jekyll generates static HTML files so that my website loads faster and is less vulnerable to attacks compared to a dynamic WordPress site that relies on a database. This means I can focus on creating more content and less on dealing with potential security issues or performance bottlenecks.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>In the end, Jekyll was the clear winner for me because it provided the perfect balance of flexibility, control, and learning potential. It is a platform that aligned with my passion for coding and understanding CI/CD pipelines, as well as heightening other skills. If you are looking for a powerful and developer-friendly way to build a website, I highly recommend giving Jekyll a try. Thank you for taking the time to read my story, and I look forward to sharing more about my experiences and giving you all tutorials on how I manage to accomplish everything you see here and in future posts!</p> <hr/> <h2 id="links">Links</h2> <p>I’d also like to give a special shoutout to <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat">Reddit user alshedivat</a> and their 209 contributors for creating the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">ai-folio template</a>, which has been incredibly helpful in my Jekyll journey. If you’re interested in learning more about Jekyll, be sure to check out the official <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll website</a>.
