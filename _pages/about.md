Hi, I’m Tyler, a System Administrator and technology enthusiast with a passion for building, automating, and continuously improving the systems that power modern infrastructure.

I was born in Tennessee and raised in Florida, but my professional journey truly began during my active duty service in the U.S. Army from 2019 to 2025, where I served as a 25B (Information Technology Specialist). The Army gave me hands-on experience managing enterprise systems, troubleshooting complex environments, and operating in high-pressure situations where reliability and precision mattered. It also gave me the opportunity to travel throughout Europe and Asia, visiting seven countries and gaining a broader perspective on both technology and the world.

Today, I work as a System Administrator, where I focus on maintaining and improving platform services that teams rely on every day. I have a strong interest in automation and use Python to streamline operations and reduce manual overhead. I’ve built automation workflows and integrations for tools like Jira, Keycloak, Confluence, SonarQube, and ArgoCD; helping improve efficiency, consistency, and reliability across environments.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me in my homelab experimenting with Kubernetes, containers, monitoring stacks, and new infrastructure tooling. I enjoy breaking things (intentionally), rebuilding them better, and documenting what I learn along the way.

When I’m not behind a keyboard, I’m usually playing basketball, swimming, hiking, or exploring somewhere new. Staying active keeps me balanced, and I approach personal growth the same way I approach technology, with discipline, curiosity, and a drive to improve.

I believe technology is best learned by building, and that every problem is an opportunity to design something better than before. This blog is where I document that journey, the wins, the lessons, and the experiments.

Thanks for stopping by. If you’re into automation, infrastructure, or just enjoy talking tech, feel free to connect.
